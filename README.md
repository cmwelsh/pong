# Pong

This is a basic demo of how to create a game of pong with JavaScript and HTML
2D Canvas Context.

A live demo is available online at http://pong.cwelsh.com if you're
interested in taking a look.

## Controls

The controls are shared between both players on the same device, so it works
best if you use a touch-capable device such as an iPhone or iPad. Mouse
support is also in place.
